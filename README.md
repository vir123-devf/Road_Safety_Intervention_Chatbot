# 🚦 Road Safety Intervention Chatbot (RAG-Powered)

This chatbot is a GPT-based AI tool designed to identify the most appropriate road safety interventions for specific traffic safety issues observed within a road network. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search and retrieve relevant guidance from a curated database of interventions compiled from global best practices, IRC and MoRTH guidelines, and road safety audit reports.

The tool accepts descriptive input about road safety concerns—such as the type of road, nature of the hazard, and surrounding environmental conditions—and returns intervention recommendations that are:

* Tailored to the specific problem described
* Supported by relevant clauses or sections from the intervention database
* Clearly explained for transparency and traceability

Built using Streamlit, FAISS, HuggingFace embeddings, and Cohere’s `command-r-plus` model, the chatbot provides a user-friendly interface for engineers, planners, and traffic safety professionals to generate actionable, evidence-based decisions for improving road safety.

## 📘 Project Use Case

**Road safety intervention planning** often requires context-aware decisions based on road type, the specific safety issue, and local conditions. This tool enables quick identification of suitable interventions using AI by:

* Automatically interpreting the described problem
* Searching a curated interventions database
* Providing recommended solutions supported by official sources

It is especially useful for:

* Road safety auditors
* Transportation engineers
* Traffic planning authorities
* Urban development and smart city initiatives
